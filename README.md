Computational Neurodynamics Course 
----------------------------------

This is the code repository for the Computational Neurodynamics course at the
Department of Computing, Imperial College London (course code C421).

Course taught by Prof. Murray Shanahan (www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpsha) with the help
of the members of the Neurodynamics lab (http://neurodynamics.doc.ic.ac.uk).


## Important information

Lab sessions take place **every Tuesday at 11am in Huxley room 202/206**.
During the lab sessions you are supposed to go through the problem sheet
corresponding to the contents of the previous lecture. You are expected
to have read the lecture notes before the lab session.

The lab helpers are there to answer questions, **not to debug code**.
They will be happy to assist you and walk you through any part of the
material you might be struggling with.

I'll be publishing important information and updates in this repo. The
recommended course of action is:

1. If you have a Github account, click on the "Watch" button above to receive
notifications.
2. If you don't have a Github account, create a Github account and proceed to
**1**.
